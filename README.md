## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I have learnt about how to make layouts with flexbox, to to center a div using flex-box.

```css
.banner {
  display: flex;
  max-width: 42.85rem;
  min-height: 32.14rem;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  border-radius: 1rem;
}
body {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  background-color: hsl(26, 40%, 92%);
}
.text-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex: 1;
  padding: 2.28rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to develop my skills on Responsive web development using flexbox & CSS Grid. I am also looking forward to learn some of css properties like clamp, min, max, autofit etc. Then, I'll learn about how to make cool animations & special effects using CSS.
